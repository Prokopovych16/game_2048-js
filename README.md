Developed an online version of the 2048 puzzle game, built from scratch using modern web technologies. This project focuses on creating a smooth, interactive, and responsive gaming experience.

**Key Technologies and Techniques:**
- JavaScript for Game Logic:
  - Manages core gameplay mechanics like tile movement, merging, random tile generation, and score calculation.
  - Handles real-time user input via keyboard controls, efficiently updating the game state.
  - Implements logic for checking win and lose conditions, ensuring a fully functional and engaging game loop.
- HTML5 Canvas:
  - Renders the game grid and tiles, providing smooth visual updates.
  - Utilizes the Canvas API for drawing game elements, resulting in seamless animations and an immersive gameplay experience.
- CSS3 for Styling:
  - Applies responsive design techniques, allowing the game to adapt to different screen sizes, from desktop to mobile devices.
  - Includes CSS transitions and hover effects to enhance the visual appeal of tile movements and merges.
- Modular Code Structure:
  - Follows clean, organized, and modular JavaScript code to ensure maintainability and scalability.
  - Breaks down the game into distinct components such as grid management, tile merging, and input handling.

**How to Play:**  
The objective of the game is to combine tiles with the same number to reach the 2048 tile. 
Use the arrow keys to move the tiles up, down, left, or right. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one, adding their values.
